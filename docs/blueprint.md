## Core Features:

- Timeline Grid: Display two rows of 61 selectable square tiles, representing months over the last 5 years, starting from the current month minus 5 years.
- Range Selection: Implement range selection: Highlight all tiles between two clicked tiles in the same row, enabling users to define date ranges for work and gap history.
- Differentiated Highlighting: Highlight selected work history ranges in material green and gap history ranges in material brown.
- Dynamic Year Labels: Display year labels dynamically, aligning above their respective 12-month periods and adjusting to screen resizing.
- Dynamic Start Month: Automatically determine the initial month for the timeline based on the current system date, ensuring correct representation of the 5-year history.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Olive (#556B2F) to suggest a sense of history and grounding. This will be used as an accent for the range selector buttons.
- Background color: Soft Beige (#F5F5DC) to create a clean and unobtrusive background, and also harmonize well with the primary color.
- Accent color: Burnt Sienna (#E97451) for contrast and focus on selected areas in the timeline.
- Headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for year labels.
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for the numerical labels within the tiles, providing clarity and readability.
- Employ clear year dividers using fine lines to delineate each year's boundary. Align year labels precisely above the corresponding months.
- Incorporate a subtle fade-in animation when highlighting the tiles for a smoother user experience.
